Windows 8 and Windows 10 hardening

1. Windows firewall, white listing of applications allowed to communicate out
2. AppLocker configuration, preferably with cert based limits - dll based makes the system too slow.
3. Disable powershell for standard users with applocker. You can also try the powershell restrictions, but these are easy to bypass.
4. EMET for antiexploitation (take time to configure the applications, don't just use the default ones).
5. Install applications with different users for application separation.
6. Do not install applications with elevated privileges.
7. No antivirus or similar "security product" for experienced users - these often pose higher risks, list below. For standard users, it may worth thinking about it.
8. If you use the computer for browsing, make sure the browser is hardened (eg. NoScript, Request Policy..etc)
